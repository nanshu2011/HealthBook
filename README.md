HW5
- We have one error when validating with an input tag inside of an a tag. Could not find a solution for this at the time.
- Edit.html may not work when you have an uploaded image.
- The HTML files may have a little bit of white space which I am not sure how to fix.
- All the minimized files are in a folder called dist.
- All functions of POC work but UI part needs to be fixed. (Screen Size.. etc)
- Even if user log out, the app works as it seems. (Rollbar catches that error - After user log out, currentuser will be NULL)
- None of our teammember has a Macbook, and PhoneGap requires a developer certificate in order to compile the package
  for IOS. Thus, we only compiled the package for Android phone.
